# Cards

 A project that aims to help students learn more effectively by using 
devices and tools such as flashcards, quizzes, gamifications to help 
make learning personalized and fun for learners.

## Getting Started

 * If you want to contribute to this project, you first have to set up your
flutter environment if you haven't already.

	The link to the below should help you achieve just that:
	- view the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/),
 	  which offers tutorials,samples, guidance on mobile development,
	  and a full API reference.

* Fork this repo and create your own branch of this code base
	(all codes should be done on your own branch and never on the
	 forked repo)

* Create a new branch off of the new repo you created from the fork.

* Pull the code from github onto your local machine 
	(you can search how to do that from a simple google search)

* Now open the project in your favourite code editor or IDE and 
  type in the following command into the terminal 
	```dart pub get```
  This will download all the dependencies of the project to help you get started.

## Contributing

  We cherish creativity and variety and hence are ready to receive help from
  anyone with the project. However, we would like each contribution to be of 
  merit to the project and not impede or disrupt this project.

  Hence, here are some things to keep in mind before contributing to this project:

  - Never write your code on the main branch. Create a new branch and work on it.
  
  - Before you push your code, make sure you have tested it. We are very busy and would not condone non serious contributors who are lazy at their work.
  
  - Keep the professionalism. Don't submit unnecessary pull requests or issues,
    as this would greatly waste our little precious time.
